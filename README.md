Create two functions which will help us to find the LCM & GCF(Greatest Common Factor) of any two numbers.
GCF Common Factor(GCF): The greatest common Factor to any two or more than two integer numbers is known as GCF or HCF 

Example: GCF of 12 and 18 is 6

Lowest Common Factor(LCM): The smallest or lowest common multiple of any two  or more than two integers numbers is termed as LCM

Example: LCM of 12 an 18 is 36
